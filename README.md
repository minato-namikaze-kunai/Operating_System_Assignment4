---

## 📁 Files Included

- `v2p.c` – C program for address translation
- `declaration.txt` – Declaration of originality

---

## 🧠 Objective

To simulate the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses using concepts of paging from operating systems.

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile

```bash
gcc v2p.c -o v2p
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
./v2p
```

You may be prompted to input virtual address details depending on how the code is structured.
